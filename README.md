# Copy
This is a simple python script that I made. It utilizes the os.path module to effectively copy.

# Usage
Put it in any directory. Works on all systems. Windows, OSX, Linux.

# Syntax 
The syntax is very simple: 
<code> python test.py [file] [fileyouwanttocopyto] </code> 

# Upcoming Features
I hope to expand my horizons with Python and add more features to this. Until then, this is it.
